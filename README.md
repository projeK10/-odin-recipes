# -odin-recipes

-This project is going to be a example of what I've learned in the past 2 days.

-I will be using various git commands (even though I still really don't understand it)

-I will be using html to create this website. 

-This website will be a recipe website

-I haven't learned many html elements but enough to make a website like this.
